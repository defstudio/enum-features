## Feature Check

In code feature can be checked in multiple ways for the logged user:

### Check if enabled

```php
if(AppFeature::multi_language->active()){
    //.. multi language specific code
}
```

### Check if disabled

```php
if(AppFeature::multi_language->active()){
    //.. multi language specific code
}
```

### Enforced

```php

AppFeature::impersonate->enforce(); //throws a 403 exception if not active

```

## Feature Check for a given scope

Each check can be applied to a scope different from the logged user:

```php

$user = User::find(42);

if(AppFeature::multi_language->active($user)){
    //.. multi language specific code
}

if(AppFeature::multi_language->active($user)){
    //.. multi language specific code
}

AppFeature::impersonate->enforce($user); //throws a 403 exception if not active

```

## Multiple feature checks

This package can check for multiple feature at once as well:

### All Active

```php

if(AppFeature::areAllActive([AppFeature::multi_language, AppFeature::welcome_email])){
    //.. 
}

```

### Some Active

```php

if(AppFeature::someAreActive([AppFeature::multi_language, AppFeature::welcome_email])){
    //.. 
}

```

### All Inactive

```php

if(AppFeature::areAllInactive([AppFeature::multi_language, AppFeature::welcome_email])){
    //.. 
}

```

### Some Inactive

```php

if(AppFeature::someAreInactive([AppFeature::multi_language, AppFeature::welcome_email])){
    //.. 
}

```
